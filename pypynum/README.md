### The Zen of PyPyNum (Preview)

```
                The Zen of PyPyNum, by Shen Jiayi

In this mathematical sanctuary, we weave our algorithms with pure Python threads.

Precision outweighs approximation.
Elegance in mathematics transcends the bulky algorithms.
Clarity in logic illuminates the darkest problems.
Simplicity in form is the pinnacle of sophistication.
Flat hierarchies in our code mirror the linear nature of functions.
Sparse code, like a minimal polynomial, retains essence without redundancy.

The pypynum.utils module has recently introduced a new class
called RadixInt. This class is designed to facilitate the
representation and manipulation of integers in various bases,
ranging from base 2 to base 36.

The RadixInt class within the pypynum.utils module provides a
robust way to work with integers in custom bases. It allows
users to initialize instances with either a decimal number or a
string representation of a number in the desired base. The class
supports conversion between different bases, as well as basic
arithmetic operations that can be performed on integers
represented in various bases.


<<< The following are some usage examples >>>


from pypynum import RadixInt

# Base-2 and base-10 numbers
binary_num = RadixInt("1010", 2)
decimal_num = RadixInt(10, 10)
print(binary_num)  # Output: (1010)_{2}
print(decimal_num)  # Output: (10)_{10}
binary_to_octal = RadixInt("1010", 2).to_base(8)
print(binary_to_octal)  # Output: (12)_{8}
# Addition
result_add = binary_num + decimal_num
print(result_add)  # Output: (20)_{10}
# Base-8 and base-10 numbers
octal_num = RadixInt("123", 8)
decimal_num = RadixInt(5, 10)
# Subtraction
result_sub = octal_num - decimal_num
print(result_sub)  # Output: (78)_{10}
# Base-16 and base-2 numbers
hex_num = RadixInt("1A", 16)
binary_num = RadixInt("11", 2)
# Multiplication
result_mul = hex_num * binary_num
print(result_mul)  # Output: (78)_{10}
